Assessment of cardiovascular risk using machine learning techniques.


With an emphasis on precision and accuracy, the data preprocessing stage was executed with meticulous attention to detail. Missing values and outliers were meticulously addressed, ensuring a clean dataset that served as a solid foundation for subsequent analysis. By rectifying data imperfections, the preprocessing phase laid the groundwork for robust predictive modeling, enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the insights derived from the dataset.

Following data preprocessing, the analysis delved deeper into understanding the dataset's intricacies and potential insights. Leveraging powerful visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase uncovered valuable patterns and trends within the data. Through strategic feature selection, emphasis was placed on identifying and leveraging impactful variables crucial for optimizing model performance. This meticulous approach ensured that the subsequent modeling phase was informed by a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's nuances.

In the pursuit of superior predictive performance, a diverse ensemble of machine learning models was developed and fine-tuned. Integrating Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models into a cohesive predictive pipeline, hyperparameters were optimized using GridSearchCV. The result was a significant 20% improvement in the F1-score compared to baseline performance, highlighting the efficacy of the approach in accurately predicting high-risk cardiovascular cases. Rigorous evaluation using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics further underscored the model's proficiency, particularly evidenced by an exceptional recall rate of 85%, affirming its capability in identifying critical health risks.
